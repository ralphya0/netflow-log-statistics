netflow-log-statistics
======================
          netflow-log-statistics makes use of apache spark 0.9.1 and is part of a research project
     that I worked with others recentlly.This program is used to analysis netflow log files
     generated by router and compute important statistics from them. The output results of this
     program can be useful to perform other algorithms against.
          
          Important statistics are as follows (within one minute):
          
          
                    long fPackets;      //forwrad connection packets number
          	long fBytes;        //forward connection bytes number
          	long bPackets;      //backward connection packets number
          	long bBytes;        //backward connection bytes number
          	int minFpktLen;     //minimal forward connection packet length
          	int maxFpktLen;     //max forward connection packet length
          	int meanLenFsm;     //mean of forward connection packet length
          	double stdLenFqsm;  //variance of forward connection packet length
          	int minBpktLen;     //backward ...
          	int maxBpktLn;
          	int meanLenBsm;
          	double stdLenBqsm;
          	double Ftotalduration;        //total duration of forward connection
          	double Favgduration;          //average duration of forward connection
          	int FcountdurationMore1;      //number of forward connections which lasts more
          	                              //than 1 sec
          	int FcountdurationLess1;      //number of forward connections which lasts less
          	                              //than 1 sec
          	double Btotalduration;        //backward ...
          	double Bavgduration;
          	int BcountdurationMore1;
          	int BcountdurationLess1;
          	long fLess100;      //number of forward packets which is smaller than 100 bytes
          	long bLess100;      //backward...
          	long fLess500;
          	long bLess500;
          	long fLess1000;
          	long bLess1000;
          	long fBig1000;
          	long bBig1000;
          	long FavePktPerSecond;        //average packet length of forward connection every
          	                              //second
          	long BavePktPerSecond;
          	int InnerOneToMulty;
          	int OutOneToMulty;

Instructions to Run This Program
================================
          Note that before you run this program you should have spark 0.9.1 and hadoop 2.2.0
      installed.
          
          First you should build this program use maven:
                    mvn package
          
          then you can submit this program to your spark-on-yarn cluster like this:
                    SPARK_JAR=path_to_your_spark_jar \
                    ./bin/spark-class org.apache,spark.submit.yarn.Client \
                    --jar path_to_the_jar_of_this_program_you_just_build \
                    --class me.ralphya0.netflow_log_statistics.NetflowStatistics \
                    --args xxx
                    ...
                    
          Please refer to source code to learn about the arguments needed.
