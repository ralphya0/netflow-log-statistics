netflow-log-statistics
======================
          netflow-log-statistics makes use of apache spark 0.9.1 and is part of a research project that I worked
     with other recentlly.This program is used to analysis netflow log files generated by router and compute
     important statistics from them. The output results of this program can be useful to perform other
     algorithms against.
          
          Important statistics are as follows (within one minite):
          
          
                    long fPackets;      //forwrad packets number
          	long fBytes;        //forward bytes number
          	long bPackets;      //backward packets number
          	long bBytes;        //backward bytes number
          	int minFpktLen;     //minimal forward packet length
          	int maxFpktLen;     //max forward packet length
          	int meanLenFsm;     //mean of forward packet length
          	double stdLenFqsm;  //variance of forward packet length
          	int minBpktLen;     //backward ...
          	int maxBpktLn;
          	int meanLenBsm;
          	double stdLenBqsm;
          	double Ftotalduration;        //total duration of forward connection
          	double Favgduration;          //average duration of forward connection
          	int FcountdurationMore1;      //number of forward connections which lasts more than 1 sec
          	int FcountdurationLess1;      //number of forward connections which lasts less than 1 sec
          	double Btotalduration;        //backward ...
          	double Bavgduration;
          	int BcountdurationMore1;
          	int BcountdurationLess1;
          	long fLess100;      //number of forward packets which is smaller than 100 bytes
          	long bLess100;      //backward...
          	long fLess500;
          	long bLess500;
          	long fLess1000;
          	long bLess1000;
          	long fBig1000;
          	long bBig1000;
          	long FavePktPerSecond;        
          	long BavePktPerSecond;
          	int InnerOneToMulty;
          	int OutOneToMulty;
